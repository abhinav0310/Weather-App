# Weather-App
This is a web application that allows you to view real-time weather conditions of any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The application is built using Node.js and Express for the backend, and Bootstrap and CSS for the frontend. EJS is used as a templating engine to dynamically render the frontend HTML pages with real-time weather data received from the backend.
